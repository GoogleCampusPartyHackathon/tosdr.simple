# ToS;DR Simple
Entry for the Google Chrome Incognito Hackathon
The initial plan was to integrate more than one service (PrivacyParrot, anyone?),
but I actually didn't get to code on this extension as much as I would have liked.
There are simply too much things to do at Campus Party Europe ;)

## Notice
Along the way I noticed that the good guys over at [ToS;DR](http://www.tos-dr.info) already
prototyped an extension using their services. I did not know that when I started coding ToS;DR Simple or I would probably have thought of something else. Their extension is much better than mine and should be prefered.
